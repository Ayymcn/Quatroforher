        "question": "How is Quatro For Her different from hormone replacement therapy (HRT)?",
        "answer": "Unlike HRT, Quatro For Her does not contain synthetic hormones. Instead, it combines natural plant extracts, synbiotics, and supportive nutrients that work in harmony with your body. This makes it a safe alternative for women who prefer or need to avoid hormone-based treatments."

      "q2": {
        "question": "Is it safe if Iâ€™ve had breast cancer?",
        "answer": "Yes. Quatro For Her is specifically designed for women who cannot or do not wish to take hormones, including those with a history of hormone-dependent cancers. Its formula is free from estrogen and works through natural, non-hormonal pathways to support comfort and balance. (As with any supplement, we recommend consulting your healthcare professional before starting.)"

      "q3": {
        "question": "How long before I feel results?",
        "answer": "Every woman is unique, but many notice improvements such as reduced hot flashes, better sleep, and improved comfort within the first 3â€“4 weeks of consistent use. Maximum benefits are usually felt after 2â€“3 months as the body restores balance."
